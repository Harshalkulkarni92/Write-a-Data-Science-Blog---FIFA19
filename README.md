## Installation

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. 
The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation

For this project, I was interestested in using FIFA 19 Complete Player Dataset to better understand:  

Question 1: Which Nation has most number of Soccer Players collected in FIFA 19, list the top 20 Nations  

Question 2: How about the age distribution of the FIFA 19 Players?  

Question 3: Find out the top 10 clubs with highest total player market value, and the highest average player wage  

Question 4: Choose the best squad  

Question 5: Correlation between Age, Overall, Potential, Position, Club, Nationality, Special vs Value/Wage  

## File Description

There is 1 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions. The notebook is exploratory in searching through 
the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. 
Markdown cells & comments were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

**data.csv —** This file is the complete dataset contains all informaiton on players attribute, personal data and position with ratings.

## Results

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@harshalkulkarni92/data-science-for-football-managers-2da91c61f01)
